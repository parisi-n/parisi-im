It was the 24th of May and in Amsterdam - at [Vrje University](https://vrje.nl) - the event *Towards better health&care: the potential of AI* has had place held by AMDS (you can find the official community group [here](https://www.meetup.com/it-IT/amsterdam-medical-data-science/).

But before dive into the topic - let's have step back.

## What AMDS is

{{< img src="amds.jpeg" align="center" title="Amsterdam Medical Data Science" >}}

AMDS stands for [Amsterdam Medical Data Science](https://www.amsterdammedicaldatascience.nl/) and is a group (the official community group is on _meetup.com_) with over 2000 enthusiast doctors (and _data scientists_) that somehow work into the healthcare: meetings are said where _doctors meet data scientists and data scientists meet doctors_ in order to talk about *data* and everything is around *the medicine of tomorrow*.

These two categories is are to speak the same language and is even more rare they may have the possibility to meet each other. Most of the time they speak a different language and a group cannot understand the other - and vice versa.

The group is kept on by *Dr. Paul Elbers* (Amsterdam UMC - _Intensivist doctor_) and by *Dr. Mark Hoogendoorn* (VU University Amsterdam - _Mathematic_) - with the financial support of _Amsterdam UMC_  and of _VU University Amsterdam_.

The aim of the group is to empower the healthcare offer - tailing a medicine on the patient measure and to put the patient with her or him unique features at the center the journey - instead of at the conclusion of standardized processes.


I dati in medicina sono una grande ricchezza; la quantità con cui vengono giornalmente generati però non va di pari passo alla qualità con cui vengono raccolti e ciò si riflette su uno scarso uso che invece ne viene fatto.

Nei meetup, solitamente a cadenza mensile, si discute di _medical data science_ - ovvero di progetti in corso, sviluppi, iniziative, opportunità che hanno a che fare con l'ambiente medico e dei dati.

Il tutto accompagnato da *pizza*.

## The event

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
I couldn't avoid to notice as the final person of the healthcare service has never be named as a _patient_ but as **customer** or **user**.
Into the speech held by healthcare operators sometimes it has been called _patient_ but most of the time the final person has been labeeld as **customer**.
{{< /alert >}}

The event has been held in english - but it is not been only a meet-up - but a full-day event with _workshops_, _postering_ on developing projects and speech about futures and theoretical developments.

But the thing outmost enlighted me was not the topics but *speakers*.

For the first time I head *doctors, colleagues speaking with the same languages usually informatics do - with an universal technical language.
Hearing specific buzzwords such as _random forest, logistic regression, support-vector machine_ spread along the speech with high-medicine-content topics moved me. Really.

## The program

Extremely interesting the _keynote_ held by _Sandjai Bhulai_ entitled *Artificial Intelligence in healthcare … it matters!* where he showed how a well fit AI algorithm *based on the most common event-position that require an ambulance to be solved* may reduce drastically the on-site time to arrive - overall in case of _high requested ambulace_ period in specific day - just making them move along specific path to cover the territory has been left uncovered by another ambulance moved to an event-site.

But the most he showed how the the number of movements required to get a reasonable _time-to-arriva_ onsite was quite feasable preserving the life-job quality for the with a human squad.

But as long they couldn't implement the AI algo into the _operations center_ they thought the operator to think as the AI may do with great results indeed.

*Top!*

Another interesting speech has been *Applying AI to address the complex health care problem of falls in older persons* held by _Noman Dormosch & Bob van de Loo_ in which just allowing the patient to choose the hospital they wanted to be admited *into the first aid phase* ranked by the time they may had to wait according to the supposed health-problem (in the speech example: femorous fracture) has enough to make *the choice of less ranked hospital acceptable by the patient where otherwise they may have complained about*.

* * *

Into the speech *Translating AI into Radiological practice* by _Henk Marquering_  (Radiologist) he tells us about the various _winters_ the AI faced during his job-experience, *the study of radiological images*.
The AI probably never will replace the Radiologist operator; but we can be sure the tech will improve, empower and get better the job.
Also because in case of _missed diagnosis_ - will never the AI algorithm be called in cause (into Tribunals - I mean - in Italy) and condemned?

## Conclusions

I warmly suggest to attend such events for those who may be interested (Italian collegaues: give me a shout! :grin: - and let's go togheter the next event!): they empower the self-awereness that the _data analysys and its derivates_ may be a winner-player into the medical competences.

I'd like to close the post with a phrase always remarks this concept in a extra-layer: **"I profile versus T profile"**.
