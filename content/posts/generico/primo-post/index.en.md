First post is forever, it is like a opening party.

Long time I wanted to write my professional ideas down on the web - after I did it for my other passion - the protography.

So, here I am.

I needed a place to write down my progress, my professional or developing suggestions, a place to keep track of my journey.

## Who I am

I am Nicola Parisi - and I am a doctor.

I find myself quite atypical - considering my passion for informatic and coding. I am not a real writer and neither I am an artist.

I love coding most of the time, but focusing on medicine field and building apps can improve my job-life or pushing it over the extra mile.

I am quite confindent **one day** I'll try a way to join _medicine_ and _informatic_ (I'm not an engineer! :grin:), maybe right on these pages.

So far they are two different lines, not crossed yet.

## Needs

I realized I had the need of a page to talk about my progresses in Python, why I'd like to learn R as well even though I need Python so far and I'm sticking to the point; I had the need of a space I may tell the story of the time I setted up a _Raspberry Pi 4_ to build my _first and personal VPS_ up.

Recently I read _Mastering Bitcoin_ and I wanted a place to talk of it about.

## DaysOfCoding

Can't wait to start _#DaysOfCoding_.

Really.

## Hugo

It is my static site generator since the pre-pandemic time. It is the silent but powerful engine it allows this site to stand on the web.

A website, albeit a blog - it is a endless job; it is like the house you live in you are never happy with something and you work hard to improve it and make it more confortable to live, day by day.

## A Doctor who doesn't speak about medicine
I find technical posts boring.

I'll be talking about opinions, my personal points of view.

_Enjoy your staying here,_

_Nicola._
