Literature about _machine learning_ is extremely broad and offers different point of views and suggestions on the way learning - but this is mostly IT-oriented, for techies - and the only discriminant may be the language one is getting approach (_R vs Python_).
Overall - these books' target is most of the time for beginners.

Hard duty has been finding a textbook that - even talking about tech ML and AI - were oriented, written and thought for the medical fields. Something that may inspire the _medical informatics_ they we very like or just may inspire a new project, a new feature, a new way of thinking daily-life medical problems.

That's why I am basically enthusiastic on talking about _Healthcare analytics made simple_ - by Vikas Kumar.

## The author

In order to fully get the mindset the book has been written is a good option to have a glance on the [author's LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikas-kumar-md-1a1a2525/).

**Medical degree** at the _Pittsburgh University_ - he continues his education with a _master degree_ in **Science informatics and engineering** at the _Georgia Institute of Technology_.

On his profiles he describes himself as "_Sr Data Scientist at OMNY Health | Teaching Assistant, Data & Visual Analytics at Georgia Tech | Author | Course Content Creator_".

## The book

### Book's target
A book written by a MD to MDs willing to learn the basis of _ML_ - and to data scientists that are willing to undergo the medical field for job reasons.
It starts from the basic both for medical terminology and Python language.

Most of the time these two groups are hard to communicate each other; sometimes they even don't. This is the aim of the book: provide to _non-healthcare operators solid basic on predictive algorithms_ and to _data scientists to approach to medical terminology_.

In the first chapters are illustrated the **basis for understand python language**: how to **import a dataset with numpy or pandas** - which approach had better to be while approaching a dataset (the author don't directly say it, but just remember: *garbage in, garbage out*).

### Detailed

The authors begins with an _excursus_ on Numpy and Pandas - main methodic to clean and organize the table dataset - and keeps illustrating some statistical rule time by time when it is needed to fully understand the concept it is going to be explained.

_Sensitivity, sensibility, negative/positive predictive value, false-positive rate_ are referred just before dive in the building of a database similar to an *SQLite* EMR (_electronic medical record).

A brief chapter is also dedicated to _matplotlib_ and how to introduce it into the workflow pipeline.

* * *

A complete chapter is however dedicated to **databases**: _SQL vs noSQL_, **why choosing SQL** and he introduces step by step a series of tables aimed to save **medical data** accordingly.

**CURD** operations are introduced related to SQLite databases: _Create_, _Update_, _Read_, _Delete_.

* * *

Once basis are built - he introduces the next step: **where and how use 'em** along with **Jupyter Notebooks** in order to build a from-zero predictive model inspired to most **requested US healthcare needs**.

* * *

Last chapter encloses a fast but complete digression on _deep learning_ and related ethical and moral problems bounded to the technology.

### Practical

Almost half of the book is dedicated about realizing health projects to solve practical problems: one for all - **reduce the readmission in the Emergency Department** once the patient has been discharged - measuring indirectly the _healthcare quality provided_ (that model applies with some differences also for ESRD - _End Stage Renal Disease_ patients).

## Final opinion

A must-have or at least must-read book to all those MDs willing to start or boost their competences into the data analysis - both for enhancing department quality or research reasons - or just for those looking for a valid help while building predictive-only _own-data-based_ models.

However - also already skilled MDs may find it interesting for a general refreshness of the basis.

My final opinion: **strongly advised for beginners**.
